# When asked to initialize documentation
    - If there are critical & complex part, you can create specific documentation around certain parts
    too (optional)
- Then update the README.md, make sure you include an index of all documentation created in .agent, so
anyone can just look at README.md to get full understanding of where to look for what information
- Please consolidate docs as much as possible, no overlap between files, e.g. most basic version just
need project_architecture.md, and we can expand from there

# When asked to update documentation
- Please read README.md first to get understanding of what already exist
- Update relevant parts in system & architecture design, or SOP for mistakes we made
- In the end, always update the README.md too to include an index of all documentation files

# When creating new doc files
Please include Related doc section, clearly list out relevant docs to read for full context
